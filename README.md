# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with TensorFlow/Keras

## Introduction

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to model sequential data by capturing temporal dependencies. They are widely used in applications such as:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling.
- **Time-series Analysis**: Forecasting stock prices or weather patterns.
- **Speech Recognition**: Decoding audio signals into text.

This guide demonstrates implementing an RNN using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** layers, a popular RNN variant that mitigates issues like vanishing gradients.

## Model Architecture
This RNN consists of:

Embedding Layer (for text data): Converts words into dense vector representations.
LSTM Layer: Captures long-term dependencies in sequences.
Dense Output Layer: Outputs predictions.

## Project Overview

The primary goal is to:
1. Train an RNN model to understand patterns in sequential data.
2. Evaluate its performance on unseen data.
3. Predict outcomes using the trained model.

This project uses the **Keras Functional API** for flexibility in defining the model.
